# PowerEurope

A citizen-led advocacy campaign for European energy sovereignty.

**Not left. Not right. Forward.**

## The Thesis

Europe cannot compete in AI, defend itself, or maintain its way of life without cheap, abundant energy.

## The Path

1. **Immediate**: Suspend carbon taxes, reopen coal as bridge capacity
2. **Medium-term**: Grid expansion, SMR deployment, domestic uranium enrichment
3. **Long-term**: Massive nuclear buildout, energy cost parity with US/China
