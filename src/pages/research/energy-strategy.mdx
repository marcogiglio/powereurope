Europe faces an energy crisis that threatens its industrial base, security, and prosperity. This analysis presents the case for a pragmatic three-phase strategy: coal as an immediate bridge, rapid nuclear buildout, and eventual coal phase-out as nuclear capacity comes online.

## The Current Situation

European industrial electricity prices have diverged dramatically from global competitors:

| Region | Industrial Price (€/MWh) | Change since 2019 |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| European Union | 145 | +52% |
| United States | 58 | +8% |
| China | 62 | +12% |

*Source: Eurostat, EIA, IEA (2024 data)*

This 2.5x cost disadvantage is not temporary. It is structural—the result of policy choices accumulated over two decades.

### Consequences Already Visible

The impact is measurable:

- **BASF** has announced it will shift chemical production to China and the US, citing energy costs
- **Volkswagen** is considering closing German plants for the first time in company history
- **ArcelorMittal** has idled blast furnaces across Europe
- **Microsoft, Google, and Amazon** are building AI data centers in the US and Nordic regions, not central Europe

Energy-intensive industry is leaving Europe. Once gone, it will not return.

## Part I: Why Coal Must Be the Bridge

The argument for coal is not ideological—it is arithmetic. Europe needs baseload power that can be deployed immediately while nuclear capacity is built.

### The Baseload Problem

Electricity grids require constant, reliable power—baseload—to function. In 2024, European baseload requirements averaged 280 GW. The sources capable of providing this are:

| Source | Capacity Factor | Dispatchable | Time to Deploy |
|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Coal | 80-85% | Yes | Months (existing) |
| Gas | 85-90% | Yes | 2-3 years |
| Nuclear | 90-93% | Yes | 10-15 years |
| Wind | 25-35% | No | 3-5 years |
| Solar | 11-15% | No | 1-2 years |
| Hydro | 35-45% | Partial | Geography-limited |

*Capacity factor = actual output / theoretical maximum output*

Coal plants already exist. They can be restarted in months. No other dispatchable source can be deployed at scale before the 2030s.

### The German Case Study

Germany's *Energiewende* provides a natural experiment in coal phase-out without nuclear replacement:

**2010-2024 Changes:**
- Nuclear capacity: 20 GW → 0 GW
- Coal capacity: 45 GW → 35 GW (with further closures planned)
- Wind + Solar capacity: 45 GW → 145 GW
- Industrial electricity price: €85/MWh → €180/MWh (peak 2022), €140/MWh (2024)

Despite adding 100 GW of renewable capacity, prices increased because the grid still requires baseload from gas—now imported at high cost—and remaining coal.

**Key insight:** Variable renewables do not replace dispatchable capacity. They add to it.

### The Proposal

1. **Suspend carbon taxes** on coal-fired electricity generation for 10 years
2. **Restart idled coal capacity** across Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, and other nations with existing plants
3. **Maintain coal generation at 2024 levels** (approximately 400 TWh/year) until nuclear replacement capacity is operational

This is not a permanent solution. It is buying time.

## Part II: Why Renewables Alone Cannot Work

Solar and wind energy are useful supplements to a power grid. They cannot be its foundation. The constraints are physical, not political.

### The Intermittency Problem

Solar panels produce electricity when the sun shines. Wind turbines produce electricity when the wind blows. Neither can be scheduled to match demand.

**German Wind Output, January 2024:**
- Maximum hour: 48 GW
- Minimum hour: 0.8 GW
- Ratio: 60:1

A grid cannot function with 60:1 variability in a major power source. This variability must be smoothed by:
- Energy storage
- Backup dispatchable generation (gas, coal, nuclear)
- Imports from neighboring grids (which face the same weather)

### The Storage Problem

The most optimistic battery cost projections:

| Technology | Cost (€/kWh capacity) | Cycle Life | €/MWh stored |
|------------|----------------------|------------|--------------|
| Lithium-ion | 150-200 | 4,000 | 40-50 |
| Sodium-ion | 80-120 | 3,000 | 30-40 |
| Flow batteries | 200-400 | 15,000 | 15-30 |

To store one day of European electricity consumption (approximately 8,000 GWh) would require:

- **Battery cost:** €800 billion - €1.6 trillion
- **Annual replacement:** €40-80 billion (as batteries degrade)

For context, the entire EU energy sector investment in 2023 was €180 billion.

Seasonal storage—covering the difference between summer solar surplus and winter solar deficit—would require 10-20x this capacity.

### The Land Use Problem

Solar and wind are diffuse energy sources. Meeting European demand requires enormous areas:

| Scenario | Land Required |
|----------|--------------|
| 100% solar | 120,000 km² (size of Greece) |
| 100% wind | 450,000 km² (size of Sweden) |
| 70/30 mix | 200,000+ km² |

This is not hypothetical opposition. It is physics. Germany has already exhausted most suitable onshore wind sites. Offshore wind is expensive and transmission-constrained.

### The Material Problem

A renewable-only grid requires:

**Per TWh of annual generation:**
- Solar: 6,000 tonnes steel, 3,000 tonnes glass, 300 tonnes silver
- Wind: 12,000 tonnes steel, 1,500 tonnes concrete, 200 tonnes rare earths

Europe would need to increase global production of:
- Silver: +30% (for solar panels)
- Neodymium: +400% (for wind turbine magnets)
- Copper: +100% (for all electrical systems)

Supply chains for these materials run through China. European "energy independence" through renewables creates mineral dependence on China.

### The Capacity Factor Reality

Installed capacity is not equivalent to delivered energy. European averages:

| Source | Installed 1 GW delivers annually |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Nuclear | 8.0 TWh |
| Coal | 7.0 TWh |
| Gas | 5.5 TWh |
| Offshore wind | 3.5 TWh |
| Onshore wind | 2.2 TWh |
| Solar | 1.0 TWh |

To replace 1 GW of nuclear with solar requires 8 GW of solar panels—plus storage, plus backup generation for nights and cloudy days.

## Part III: Why Nuclear Is the Answer

Nuclear power is the only energy source that can provide:
- Baseload capacity (90%+ capacity factor)
- Near-zero carbon emissions
- Energy independence (fuel lasts years, not days)
- Small land footprint (1/400th of solar per TWh)

### The Economics

Nuclear plants are expensive to build and cheap to operate:

| Phase | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Construction | €5-8 billion per GW |
| Operation | €20-30/MWh |
| Fuel | €5/MWh |
| Decommissioning fund | €2/MWh |

**Levelized cost over 60-year lifespan:** €35-50/MWh

Compare to current European spot prices of €80-150/MWh. Nuclear is cheaper than the status quo.

### The French Model

France built 56 reactors (61 GW) between 1970 and 1990—twenty years. This fleet provides 70% of French electricity at €42/MWh average cost.

French industrial electricity prices are 40% below the German equivalent. French CO2 emissions per capita are half the German level.

The French model is not theoretical. It exists, it works, and it can be replicated.

### The New Technologies

Several reactor designs are now ready for deployment:

**Large PWR (EPR, APR1400):**
- Proven technology, 1.4-1.6 GW per unit
- 10-12 year construction with experienced workforce
- €5-6 billion per unit at scale

**Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):**
- 50-300 MW per unit
- Factory manufacturing, site assembly
- 4-6 year deployment once factories operational
- Suitable for replacing coal plants using existing grid connections

**High-Temperature Gas Reactors:**
- 200-600°C process heat for industry
- Can replace gas in chemical production, steel, cement
- Operating prototypes in China

### The Fuel Independence

Nuclear fuel is:
- **Energy-dense:** 1 kg of uranium = 2,700 tonnes of coal equivalent
- **Storable:** A reactor's 2-year fuel supply fits in a single warehouse
- **Available from allies:** Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Namibia

Europe could stockpile a decade of nuclear fuel for €10-20 billion—full energy independence.

Compare to natural gas: Europe consumes €200+ billion per year in gas imports, with storage sufficient for approximately 90 days.

### The Waste Reality

Nuclear waste is:
- **Small:** A 1 GW reactor produces 20 tonnes of spent fuel per year
- **Contained:** Unlike fossil fuel waste, it does not disperse into atmosphere
- **Manageable:** Finland's Onkalo repository demonstrates permanent disposal is solved

All nuclear waste produced in French history fits in a single building. The same cannot be said for coal ash, CO2, or solar panel waste.

## The Proposal: A Three-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Coal Bridge (2025-2030)

**Actions:**
- Suspend EU ETS carbon pricing for coal generation
- Restart all operable coal capacity in EU member states
- Maintain generation at 400-450 TWh/year
- Begin regulatory streamlining for nuclear construction

**Result:** Immediate price relief of €20-30/MWh for industrial users

### Phase 2: Nuclear Buildout (2026-2040)

**Actions:**
- License standardized reactor designs (EPR2, AP1000, SMRs) EU-wide
- Target 100 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2040
- Deploy SMRs at existing coal plant sites (grid connection reuse)
- Establish European nuclear fuel consortium

**Investment required:** €400-600 billion over 15 years
**Jobs created:** 500,000 direct, 1.5 million indirect

### Phase 3: Coal Phase-Out (2035-2045)

**Actions:**
- Begin retiring coal plants as nuclear capacity reaches parity
- Convert coal workforce to nuclear operations and decommissioning
- Achieve 70%+ low-carbon electricity by 2045

**Result:** Industrial electricity prices at €40-60/MWh, below current US and China levels

## Objections Addressed

### "Coal is too polluting"

Coal produces CO2 and particulates. Both are problems. Neither is insurmountable.

Modern coal plants with scrubbers emit 90% less particulates than 1980s plants. CO2 remains an issue—but 15 years of coal emissions while building nuclear capacity produces less cumulative CO2 than 50 years of gas dependence with slower nuclear build.

The choice is not coal vs. zero emissions. It is coal-then-nuclear vs. gas-forever.

### "Nuclear is too expensive"

Nuclear is expensive to build. It is cheap to operate for 60+ years.

Current European electricity prices (€100-150/MWh) already exceed nuclear's all-in costs (€40-60/MWh). The question is not "can we afford nuclear?" It is "can we afford not to build it?"

### "Nuclear takes too long"

The UAE built four 1.4 GW reactors in 12 years, starting from zero nuclear infrastructure. South Korea builds reactors in 5-6 years. China is commissioning 10+ reactors per year.

Europe built 100+ reactors in 20 years (1970-1990). The capability existed. It can be rebuilt.

### "Renewables are cheaper"

Renewables are cheaper per MWh generated when the sun shines and wind blows. They are not cheaper per MWh delivered reliably to consumers.

A system providing 24/7 power from renewables requires storage, backup, and transmission that approximately triples the cost. Nuclear provides 24/7 power directly.

## Conclusion

Europe's energy crisis is not a natural disaster. It is a policy choice. Different policies produce different outcomes.

The strategy presented here—coal as bridge, nuclear as destination—is not the only possible path. But it is a path that:

- Uses existing technology
- Has been demonstrated historically (France 1970-1990)
- Achieves the stated goals (cheap energy, low emissions, independence)
- Can begin immediately

The alternative is continued decline: higher prices, lost industry, strategic vulnerability.

Europe must choose.
