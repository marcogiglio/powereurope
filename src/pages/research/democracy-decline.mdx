The world is becoming less free. This is not speculation—it is the measured conclusion of every major democracy index. For Europe, this shift has profound implications: our values, our security, and our prosperity depend on the survival of the liberal democratic order we helped create.

## The Data

### Democracy in Retreat

Every major index shows the same pattern: democracy peaked around 2010 and has been declining since.

| Index | Peak Year | Direction Since | Countries Declining |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Freedom House | 2005 | 18 consecutive years of decline | 60+ |
| V-Dem Liberal Democracy | 2012 | Lowest level since 1986 | 42 autocratizing |
| Economist Democracy Index | 2015 | Steady decline | 74 regressed |
| Bertelsmann Transformation Index | 2010 | Sharpest decline on record | 137 countries |

### The Numbers

**2024 Global Picture:**
- **Population under authoritarian rule:** 5.7 billion (71% of world)
- **Population in full democracies:** 1.0 billion (13%)
- **Countries classified as "not free":** 56 (most since records began)
- **Countries that democratized 1990-2005:** 30+
- **Countries that autocratized 2010-2024:** 42

### The Economic Shift

Perhaps more consequential than the political shift is the economic one. Authoritarian regimes now control a larger share of global GDP than at any point since the Cold War.

| Year | Democratic Share of World GDP | Authoritarian Share |
|------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1990 | 78% | 22% |
| 2000 | 73% | 27% |
| 2010 | 64% | 36% |
| 2020 | 57% | 43% |
| 2024 | 54% | 46% |

The trend line is clear: authoritarian regimes are gaining economic ground at approximately 1 percentage point per year. At current trajectories, autocracies will control a majority of world GDP by 2030.

## The Three Waves

### Wave 1: The Democratic Surge (1989-2005)

The fall of the Berlin Wall triggered the most rapid expansion of democracy in human history:

- Soviet bloc countries transitioned to democracy
- Latin American military dictatorships fell
- African one-party states held multiparty elections
- Southeast Asian nations liberalized

**The numbers:** Freedom House counted 69 "free" countries in 1989. By 2005, there were 89.

The assumption was that this represented the "end of history"—that liberal democracy had proven itself the final form of human government, and the remaining autocracies would inevitably liberalize.

This assumption was wrong.

### Wave 2: The Authoritarian Consolidation (2005-2015)

The first warning signs appeared in Russia. Putin's consolidation of power—eliminating independent media, jailing opponents, rigging elections—was dismissed as a post-Soviet anomaly.

Then the pattern repeated:

- **Venezuela** (2005-2013): Chávez dismantled democratic institutions
- **Hungary** (2010-present): Orbán's "illiberal democracy"
- **Turkey** (2013-present): Erdoğan's authoritarian turn
- **Thailand** (2014): Military coup
- **Egypt** (2013): Military coup reversing Arab Spring
- **Philippines** (2016-present): Duterte's authoritarian populism

These were not fragile new democracies. Hungary and Turkey had decades of democratic experience. Venezuela was Latin America's oldest democracy.

### Wave 3: The Great Power Challenge (2015-present)

The current phase is defined by two developments:

**1. China's rise as an alternative model**

China's economic success—lifting 800 million people out of poverty without democratizing—shattered the assumption that economic development leads to political liberalization.

Xi Jinping has explicitly positioned the Chinese model as superior to Western democracy:
- More efficient decision-making
- Long-term planning capability
- Social stability
- Economic growth

China's GDP (PPP): $31 trillion (2024), larger than the US ($27 trillion).

**2. Russia's active subversion**

Russia has moved from merely consolidating authoritarianism at home to actively undermining democracy abroad:
- Election interference (US 2016, France 2017, Germany ongoing)
- Funding of extremist parties across Europe
- Disinformation campaigns
- Energy coercion

## Why It Happened

### The Economic Failure

The 2008 financial crisis and the eurozone crisis that followed dealt a severe blow to democracy's prestige. Millions of people in democratic countries experienced:

- Unemployment and stagnation
- Bank bailouts while households suffered
- Austerity imposed by unelected technocrats
- A sense that the system was rigged for elites

Meanwhile, China emerged from the crisis stronger, having used state intervention to maintain growth. The contrast was not lost on observers worldwide.

### The Competence Gap

Democratic governments have struggled with basic competence:

| Challenge | Democratic Response | Authoritarian Response |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Infrastructure | Decades of delays, cost overruns | China builds HSR network in 15 years |
| Pandemic (early) | Chaotic, politicized | China: brutal but effective lockdowns |
| Energy transition | Germany's Energiewende failure | China: world's largest nuclear program |
| Industrial policy | "The market will decide" | China: strategic dominance in EVs, solar, batteries |

This is not an endorsement of authoritarian methods. It is an observation that democracies have failed to deliver results that their own citizens expect.

### The Energy Weapon

Energy dependence has made democracies vulnerable to authoritarian coercion:

**Europe and Russian gas:**
- 40% of EU gas came from Russia (pre-2022)
- Germany blocked EU sanctions on Russia for years to protect Nord Stream
- Hungary continues to block EU action due to energy dependence

**Global petrostates:**
- Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar fund authoritarian movements worldwide
- Oil wealth insulates regimes from democratic pressure
- Western dependence limits response to human rights abuses

**China's energy advantage:**
- Massive investment in nuclear, hydro, coal
- Energy costs 60% below European levels
- Industrial competitiveness built on cheap power

## The European Dimension

### Democratic Backsliding Within the EU

The EU was supposed to lock in democracy. It hasn't worked.

**Hungary:**
- Classified as "partly free" by Freedom House (first EU member state)
- Government controls 80% of media
- Judiciary packed with loyalists
- Elections "free but not fair" (OSCE)
- EU unable to enforce Article 7

**Poland (2015-2023):**
- Judicial independence attacked
- Media freedom restricted
- EU rule-of-law standoff
- (Partially reversed after 2023 election)

**The pattern:** Once inside the EU, countries face few consequences for democratic backsliding. Article 7 requires unanimity—Hungary and Poland protect each other.

### Strategic Vulnerability

Europe's democratic allies are weakening or distracted:

- **United States:** Political polarization, January 6, Trump's return
- **United Kingdom:** Brexit, political instability
- **France:** Macron isolated, Le Pen rising
- **Germany:** Coalition chaos, AfD at 20%+

Meanwhile, Europe faces:
- Russia on its eastern border
- China as its largest trading partner
- Energy dependence on authoritarian suppliers
- No independent defense capability

### The GDP Reality

The EU's share of world GDP has collapsed:

| Year | EU Share of World GDP (PPP) |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 1990 | 26% |
| 2000 | 23% |
| 2010 | 19% |
| 2020 | 15% |
| 2024 | 14% |
| 2030 (proj.) | 12% |

*Source: IMF World Economic Outlook*

This is not just about economics. Economic weight translates to:
- Diplomatic influence
- Military capability
- Standard-setting power
- Ability to defend democratic values

A Europe that represents 12% of world GDP cannot shape global rules.

## The Energy Connection

This brings us back to PowerEurope's core thesis: **energy is the foundation of power**.

### The Correlation

Countries that have maintained or increased their global economic weight share one characteristic: cheap, abundant energy.

| Country/Region | Energy Cost Trend | Economic Trajectory |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| United States | Shale revolution → cheap gas | Reindustrialization |
| China | Nuclear + coal buildout | Continued growth |
| Gulf States | Domestic oil/gas | Wealthy, influential |
| European Union | Expensive, imported | Decline |

### The Mechanism

High energy costs → deindustrialization → economic decline → reduced influence → inability to defend democratic values

This is not theoretical. It is happening now:

1. **BASF moves to China** → fewer high-paying jobs → political discontent
2. **Europe can't build AI infrastructure** → strategic dependence on US
3. **Defense industry atrophied** → can't support Ukraine adequately
4. **Green transition costs → popular backlash** → votes for anti-system parties

### The Authoritarian Advantage

Authoritarian regimes make energy decisions that democracies won't:

- **China:** Building 150+ nuclear reactors while Europe debates
- **Russia:** Weaponizing gas exports (possible because they have supply)
- **UAE:** Nuclear program delivered on time and budget
- **Saudi Arabia:** Planning 16 reactors by 2040

Democratic Europe, meanwhile:
- Germany shut down its nuclear plants during an energy crisis
- Approval for new nuclear takes 15+ years
- NIMBY blocks all major infrastructure
- Environmental groups sue everything

The result: authoritarian regimes get cheap energy, democracies get expensive energy, and the balance of power shifts.

## What Must Be Done

### Accept the Diagnosis

The first step is acknowledging reality:
- Liberal democracy is in retreat globally
- The EU is weakening in relative terms
- Energy is a key factor in this decline
- Current policies are making things worse

### Rebuild Economic Power

Europe cannot defend democratic values from a position of economic weakness. This requires:

1. **Cheap energy** (see our [energy strategy](/research/energy-strategy))
2. **Industrial policy** that matches China's strategic approach
3. **Defense capability** independent of US protection
4. **Technological sovereignty** in AI, semiconductors, biotech

### Strengthen Democratic Institutions

Internal resilience matters:
- Enforce EU rule-of-law mechanisms
- Reform Article 7 to remove unanimity requirement
- Protect media independence
- Counter disinformation

### Strategic Clarity

Europe must decide what it is:
- A regulatory superpower with declining real influence?
- Or a geopolitical actor that shapes the world?

You cannot be a geopolitical actor with 14% of world GDP, energy dependence on rivals, and no military capability.

## Conclusion

The data is unambiguous: liberal democracy is losing ground to authoritarianism, and Europe is losing ground to everyone. These trends are connected.

A weak, deindustrialized Europe cannot defend democratic values at home or abroad. An energy-dependent Europe cannot resist authoritarian coercion. A Europe that represents a shrinking share of world GDP cannot shape global rules.

The choice is between managed decline and strategic renewal. Renewal requires energy sovereignty, industrial revival, and political will.

PowerEurope believes this is still possible. But the window is closing.
