Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are nuclear reactors with electrical output typically below 300 MW, designed to be manufactured in factories and transported to sites for installation. They represent a potential paradigm shift in how we build nuclear power.

## What makes an SMR "small" and "modular"?

**Small** refers to power output. Traditional large reactors generate 1,000-1,600 MW. SMRs generate 50-300 MW. This isn't a limitation—it's a design choice that enables:

- Smaller exclusion zones
- Siting flexibility (including brownfield industrial sites)
- Better match to grid capacity in smaller markets
- Lower absolute capital cost per unit

**Modular** refers to manufacturing approach. Instead of building reactors on-site (which is slow and expensive), SMRs are:

- Factory-manufactured in controlled conditions
- Transported as complete or near-complete units
- Assembled on-site in months rather than years
- Standardized for regulatory pre-approval

<KeyMessage type="insight">
**The key insight:** Traditional nuclear's cost problem is largely a construction problem. Building one-off megaprojects on-site, with bespoke designs, under constantly changing regulations, is inherently expensive. SMRs aim to solve this by making reactors more like aircraft: standardized, factory-built, and improved iteratively.

## How do SMRs work?

Most SMRs use the same fundamental physics as traditional reactors: controlled nuclear fission, where heavy atoms (usually uranium-235) split and release energy. This energy heats water (or another coolant), which drives turbines to generate electricity.

The main SMR designs fall into several categories:

### Light Water Reactors (LWRs)

The most mature technology. Uses ordinary water as coolant and moderator. Examples:

- **NuScale** (USA): 77 MW modules, NRC-approved design
- **BWRX-300** (GE-Hitachi): 300 MW, simplified boiling water design
- **Rolls-Royce SMR** (UK): 470 MW, pressurized water design

These are evolutionary—taking proven large reactor technology and scaling it down.

### High-Temperature Gas Reactors (HTGRs)

Uses helium gas as coolant, graphite as moderator. Can operate at higher temperatures, enabling industrial heat applications. Examples:

- **Xe-100** (X-energy): 80 MW, pebble-bed design
- **HTR-PM** (China): 210 MW, already operating

### Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)

Dissolves nuclear fuel in molten salt. Potentially safer (no high-pressure systems) and can use thorium fuel. Examples:

- **Terrestrial Energy IMSR**: 195 MW
- **Moltex SSR**: Uses spent nuclear fuel

These are more revolutionary—different physics, different fuel cycles, but less mature.

## The economic case

Traditional nuclear has a cost problem. Recent Western projects (Vogtle, Hinkley Point C, Flamanville) have run massively over budget. The reasons are well-understood:

1. **First-of-a-kind costs**: Each project is essentially a prototype
2. **Regulatory uncertainty**: Rules change during construction
3. **Construction complexity**: On-site megaprojects with thousands of workers
4. **Long timelines**: 10-15 years from decision to operation

SMRs aim to address all four:

| Problem | SMR Solution |
|---------|--------------|
| First-of-a-kind | Nth-of-a-kind: build the same design repeatedly |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Pre-license standardized designs |
| Construction complexity | Factory manufacturing, site assembly |
| Long timelines | 3-5 years from order to operation |

<KeyMessage type="warning">
**Important caveat:** These are projections, not proven results. No SMR has yet demonstrated low costs at scale. The first commercial units will be expensive. Cost reduction requires volume—building dozens or hundreds of units.
</KeyMessage>

## Current status (as of 2026)

### Operating

- **HTR-PM** (China): Two 105 MW units, grid-connected 2021
- **RITM-200** (Russia): Floating nuclear power plants, operating since 2020

### Under construction

- **NuScale VOYGR** (USA): First US SMR, at Idaho National Laboratory
- **ACP100** (China): 125 MW demonstration plant
- **BREST-300** (Russia): Lead-cooled fast reactor

### Licensed or in advanced licensing

- **BWRX-300**: Licensed in Canada, under review in US, UK
- **Rolls-Royce SMR**: UK Generic Design Assessment underway
- **NuScale**: US NRC Design Certification (2020)

### In development

Dozens of designs at various stages. Most will not reach commercialization.

## What SMRs mean for Europe

Europe's nuclear situation is bifurcated:

- **France**: 56 operating reactors, committed to new build (EPR2)
- **UK**: New build program (Hinkley Point C, Sizewell C), SMR initiative
- **Most of EU**: Phase-out policies, aging fleet, no new construction

SMRs could change this calculus:

1. **Lower entry barrier**: A 300 MW SMR costs €1-2 billion, not €15-20 billion
2. **Industrial sites**: Can replace coal plants, reuse grid connections
3. **Faster deployment**: Years, not decades
4. **Political feasibility**: Smaller, less visible, easier to approve

<KeyMessage type="action">
**Our position:** Europe should license proven SMR designs (BWRX-300, NuScale, Rolls-Royce) immediately and commit to serial deployment. We cannot wait for perfect—we need good enough, now.
</KeyMessage>

## Challenges and criticisms

SMRs are not a silver bullet. Legitimate concerns include:

### Economics remain unproven

No SMR has yet demonstrated competitive costs. The NuScale project saw significant cost increases before the first unit was even built. Learning curves require volume that doesn't yet exist.

### Proliferation concerns

More reactors in more locations means more nuclear material to secure. SMRs need robust safeguards frameworks.

### Waste management

SMRs produce nuclear waste, like all fission reactors. Some designs may produce more waste per unit of electricity due to lower thermal efficiency.

### Public acceptance

Nuclear remains politically contentious in many European countries. Smaller reactors may be easier to accept—or may face "not in my backyard" opposition at more locations.

## The bottom line

SMRs are not magic. They are an engineering approach to solving nuclear's cost and deployment problems. Whether they succeed depends on:

1. Regulatory frameworks that enable standardization
2. Order volumes that enable factory economics
3. Supply chain development
4. Financing models for smaller, serial units

Europe has a choice: lead in this technology, or import it later from countries that did.

We advocate for leading.
