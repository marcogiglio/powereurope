Let us be clear from the start: coal is not the future. It is dirty, carbon-intensive, and should be phased out as quickly as possible.

But "as quickly as possible" is not the same as "immediately." And pretending otherwise is not environmentalism—it is fantasy.

## The math is simple

Europe's electricity demand is growing. Electrification of transport, heating, and industry will increase demand by 50-100% by 2040. At the same time, we are closing nuclear plants—the only proven source of reliable, low-carbon baseload power.

<KeyMessage type="warning">
**Germany closed its last nuclear plants in April 2023.** Those plants provided 6% of Germany's electricity—clean, reliable, paid-for. They were replaced by... nothing. Germany now imports French nuclear power and burns more lignite.
</KeyMessage>

The arithmetic does not work. You cannot:
- Close nuclear plants
- Block new nuclear construction
- Phase out coal
- Meet growing electricity demand
- Maintain grid stability

Pick any four. You cannot have all five.

## Why coal, specifically?

Coal plants exist. They are paid for. They can ramp up and down to balance intermittent renewables. They employ workers in regions that have already suffered from deindustrialization.

Yes, coal emits more CO2 than gas. But here is what the climate purists miss: **the alternative to European coal is not zero emissions—it is Chinese coal.**

When European industry relocates to China because of energy costs, it doesn't stop emitting. It emits more, under weaker regulations, with longer supply chains. And Europe loses the industrial capacity it needs to build the clean energy future.

<KeyMessage type="insight">
**Carbon leakage is real.** A steel plant in Germany emits less CO2 per ton than a steel plant in China. When we close the German plant, global emissions go up, not down.
</KeyMessage>

## The bridge to where?

Coal is not the destination. Nuclear is.

France built 56 nuclear reactors in 15 years. Korea builds them in 5 years. China is building 150. Europe can do this—we have done it before.

But nuclear plants take time to build. Even with wartime urgency, even with streamlined regulation, we are looking at 7-10 years before new capacity comes online at scale.

What do we do in the meantime?

We have three options:

1. **Managed decline.** Accept deindustrialization, energy poverty, and strategic irrelevance. This is the current path.

2. **Russian gas.** Pretend the last two years didn't happen. Rebuild dependence on a hostile power. This is insane.

3. **Coal bridge.** Keep existing plants running, reopen closed plants, buy ourselves time to build nuclear. This is uncomfortable but realistic.

## The politics of honesty

We know this position is unpopular with climate activists. We know it will be attacked.

But we also know that the current approach is failing. European emissions have fallen, yes—but so has European industry. We have not solved the problem; we have exported it.

Real environmentalism is not about feeling virtuous. It is about results. And the result we need is:

- Europe with a strong industrial base
- Europe with energy sovereignty
- Europe with the capacity to build clean technology
- Europe that leads by example, not by lecture

You cannot achieve any of this by closing power plants before you have built replacements.

## What we advocate

1. **Immediate**: Extend the life of existing coal plants. Reopen recently closed plants where technically feasible.

2. **Parallel**: Launch emergency nuclear program. License proven designs. Cut approval times to 2-3 years.

3. **Transition**: As nuclear capacity comes online, phase out coal. Target: last coal plant closes when nuclear baseload is secured.

This is not climate denial. This is climate realism. The choice is not between coal and perfection—it is between managed transition and chaotic decline.

We choose transition. We choose building. We choose Europe.
