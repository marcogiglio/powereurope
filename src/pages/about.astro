        <h2>What We Believe</h2>

        <p>
          Europe faces an energy crisis that threatens its economy, its security, and its relevance in the 21st century.
          While the US and China build the infrastructure for an AI-powered future, Europe regulates and declines.
        </p>

        <p>We believe:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Energy is the foundation of everything.</strong> Without cheap energy, there is no industry, no defense, no prosperity, and ultimately no environmental protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Nuclear power is essential.</strong> It is the only proven technology that can provide reliable, low-carbon baseload power at scale.</li>
          <li><strong>The current path leads to decline.</strong> Europe's high energy costs are driving deindustrialization and emigration.</li>
          <li><strong>We can change course.</strong> With political will and public support, Europe can rebuild its energy infrastructure in 15 years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> We gather and publish data on European energy costs, nuclear capacity, and industrial competitiveness.</li>
          <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> We make the case for energy sovereignty to policymakers, media, and the public.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> We explain energy technology and policy in accessible terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Coalition building:</strong> We work with pro-nuclear organizations, industry groups, and citizen movements across Europe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p>
          PowerEurope is a Dutch Stichting (foundation) registered in the Netherlands. We are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Citizen-funded:</strong> We accept donations from individuals. We do not accept funding from political parties, governments, or energy companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-partisan:</strong> We work with anyone—left, right, or center—who shares our goal of European energy sovereignty.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Our data sources are public. Our methodology is documented. Our funding is disclosed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Position</h2>

        <p>
          We are often asked: "Are you pro-nuclear?" Yes. "Are you anti-renewable?" No. "Are you climate deniers?" Absolutely not.
        </p>

        <p>
          We support a diversified energy mix that prioritizes:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The grid must be stable. Baseload matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Energy costs must be competitive with global peers.</li>
          <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> Europe must not depend on hostile powers for energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Decarbonization:</strong> We support reducing emissions—through methods that actually work at scale.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          We believe nuclear power is essential to achieving all four. Renewables alone cannot provide reliable baseload.
          Fossil fuels cannot decarbonize. Only nuclear checks all four boxes.
        </p>
